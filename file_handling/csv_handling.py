Program Description:
-------------------------
Demonstration of CSV File Handling in Python
--------------------------------------------------------------
Covers:
âœ” csv.reader() / csv.writer() : Reads/writes each row of a CSV file as a list of values
âœ” DictReader / DictWriter     : Reads/writes each row as a dictionary
âœ” Filtering, iteration, and row modification
âœ” Simple product project: total price calculation
