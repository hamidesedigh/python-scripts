# 🧠 Data Science & Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of computer science that gives *computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed*.  
It is at the core of modern **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** systems.

## 🚀 Typical ML Workflow
1. **Clean the data** — handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies  
2. **Select the algorithm** — choose the best approach for the problem  
3. **Train the model** — fit data to the algorithm  
4. **Predict new cases** — use the trained model for inference

## 🧩 AI vs ML

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI aims to **mimic human intelligence** and perform cognitive tasks such as:
- 🖼️ Computer Vision  
- 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- 🎨 Creativity & Generative AI  

### Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a **subset of AI**, focused on **statistical learning from data**.  
Common ML categories include:
- 📊 **Classification**
- 📈 **Regression**
- 🧠 **Neural Networks**
- 🔍 **Clustering**

> 💡 *The recent revolution in ML is powered by **Deep Learning**, which uses neural networks with many layers.*

## 📚 Core Python Libraries
- **NumPy** — numerical computing  
- **Pandas** — data manipulation and analysis  
- **scikit-learn** — machine learning toolkit

## 🧮 Learning Paradigms

### **Supervised Learning**
The model is trained on **labeled data** (input-output pairs).  
- **Regression** → Predict continuous values (e.g., CO₂ emissions)  
- **Classification** → Predict discrete labels (e.g., *Is this tumor cancerous?*)  

### **Unsupervised Learning**
The model finds **patterns or structure** in **unlabeled data**.  
- **Clustering** → Group similar data points (e.g., bank loan segmentation)  
- **Anomaly Detection** → Detect unusual patterns (e.g., credit card fraud)  

### **Semi-Supervised Learning**
A mix of labeled and unlabeled data — often used when labeling is costly.  

### **Recommender Systems**
A specialized ML approach that suggests relevant items to users.  
Examples:
- 🎬 Netflix movie recommendations  
- 🛍️ Amazon product suggestions
