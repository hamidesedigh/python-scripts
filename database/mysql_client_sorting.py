Program Description
---------------------------
This Python program connects to a MySQL database and manages employee information (name, height, weight).
It creates a database (new_database1) and a table (people) if they do not already exist.
Sample employee data is inserted into the table if it is empty.
The program retrieves and displays all employees, sorted by height in descending order, and for equal heights, by weight in ascending order.
Finally, it safely closes the database connection.
