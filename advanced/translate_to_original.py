Description:
------------
This program translates a sentence back to its original words using a dictionary
mapping of translations in English, French, and German to the original word.

Steps:
1. Reads the number of dictionary entries.
2. For each entry, reads the original word and its translations in English, French, and German.
3. Builds a dictionary that maps any translation to the original word.
4. Reads a sentence and replaces each word with its original word if it exists in the dictionary.
5. Prints the translated sentence, leaving words unchanged if no translation is found.

Example Input:
--------------
3
chat cat chat Katze
chien dog chien Hund
maison house maison Haus
I have a dog and a cat

Example Output:
---------------
I have a chien and a chat
