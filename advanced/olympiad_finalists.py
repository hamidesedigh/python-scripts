Description:
------------
This program processes a list of finalists for a Computer Olympiad and prepares
standardized entry cards for the results committee.

Each input record includes:
    - Gender
    - Name (in a non-standard format)
    - Programming language

The input format uses a dot ('.') as a separator between fields. The program:
1. Reads the number of participants.
2. Reads each participantâ€™s record and capitalizes their name properly.
3. Sorts the records first by gender and then by name.
4. Prints a standardized list including gender, name, and language.

Example Input:
--------------
4
female.sara.python
male.ali.cpp
female.lina.java
male.reza.python

Example Output:
---------------
female Lina java
female Sara python
male Ali cpp
male Reza python
